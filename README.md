# Visual-Project-3

# Ideas
1.
Labeled Map - show nodes where radiation is detected.
No label Map - show heat map where radiation is most potent. 

2.
Overlapping map for static and mobile sensors. Will use different color schemes to show difference between them. Be able to toggle them on and off.

3.
See 1.

4. and 5.
TBD after project is completed.

Extras
Bar graph of radiation for each section of the map. Kind of like a continuation of heat map.
Hosptial exposure and maybe show evacuation routes.
