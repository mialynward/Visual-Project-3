# Ideas
1.
Labeled Map - show nodes where radiation is detected. (Braden and Robert)

No label Map - show heat map where radiation is most potent. (Mia and Arturo)

2.
Overlapping map for static and mobile sensors. Will use different color schemes to show difference between them. Be able to toggle them on and off.

3.
See 1.

4. and 5.
TBD after project is completed.

Extras

Bar graph of radiation for each section of the map. Kind of like a continuation of heat map.
Hosptial exposure and maybe show evacuation routes.
