# Ideas To Implement Challenge
1. Visualize radiation measurements over time from both static and mobile sensors to identify areas where radiation over background is detected. Characterize changes over time.

Labeled Map - show nodes where radiation is detected. (Braden and Robert)

No label Map - show heat map where radiation is most potent. (Mia and Arturo)

2. Use visual analytics to represent and analyze uncertainty in the measurement of radiation across the city.
Compare uncertainty of the static sensors to the mobile sensors. What anomalies can you see? Are there sensors that are too uncertain to  trust?
Which regions of the city have greater uncertainty of radiation measurement? Use visual analytics to explain your rationale.
What effects do you see in the sensor readings after the earthquake and other major events? What effect do these events have on uncertainty?

Overlapping map for static and mobile sensors. Will use different color schemes to show difference between them. Be able to toggle them on and off.

3. Given the uncertainty you observed in question 2, are the radiation measurements reliable enough to locate areas of concern?
Highlight potential locations of contamination, including the locations of contaminated cars. Should St. Himark officials be worried about contaminated cars moving around the city?
Estimate how many cars may have been contaminated when coolant leaked from the Always Safe plant. Use visual analysis of radiation measurements to determine if any have left the area.
Indicated where you would deploy more sensors to improve radiation monitoring in the city. Would you recommend more static sensors or more mobile sensors or both? Use your visualization of radiation measurement uncertainty to justify your recommendation.

Extras

Bar graph of radiation for each section of the map. Kind of like a continuation of heat map.
Hosptial exposure and maybe show evacuation routes.
